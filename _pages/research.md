My scientific interests are generally within the field of galaxy formation and
evolution and in particular their chemical enrichment through cosmic time. For
this I mainly work on observations across the electromagnetic spectrum of
energetic, transient phenomena such as fast radio bursts ([FRBs](frbs.md)),
gamma-ray bursts ([GRBs](grbs.md)), electromagnetic counterparts to
gravitational wave sources ([kilonovae](kilonovae.md)), and
[quasars](quasars.md).
These cosmic lighthouses are powerful probes of the interstellar and
intergalactic gas in and beyond galaxies in the line of sight. I have
particularly been interested in the specific population of absorption systems
known as damped Lyman-Î± absorbers ([DLAs](dlas.md)).


Active collaborations
======
* **The fast and fortunate for FRB follow-up
([F<sup>4</sup>](https://sites.google.com/ucolick.org/f-4), PI: J. X. Prochaska)** 
team is dedicated to the follow-up of fast radio bursts and their host galaxies
at optical to infrared wavelengths. Our main science goals are to constrain the
FRB progenitor(s) through population studies of their host galaxies and to
disentangle the cosmic web correlated with foreground galaxies and their halos.

* **[ENGRAVE](http://www.engrave-eso.org)** is a newly founded collaboration,
performing follow-up observations of **E**lectromag**n**etic counterparts of
**gra**vitational wave sources at the **Ve**ry Large Telescope detected by
LIGO/Virgo. The overarching goal of this consortium is to use Target of
Opportunity observations on the VLT targeting optical to mid-infrared follow-up
of merging compact sources such as NS-NS or BH-NS as well as other
gravitational wave (burst-type) events. 

* **Stargate (PI: Nial R. Tanvir)** is the continuation of the [XS-GRB](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019A%26A...623A..92S/abstract)
collaboration, now searching for the most exotic GRBs. We have access to
almost all instruments mounted at the four VLT unit telescopes, including
several other instruments mounted at smaller telescopes all over the world
(such as the NOT). The main science goals of this programme are to investigate
and obtain follow-up observations of high-redshift GRBs, short GRBs and
otherwise peculiar transients.
