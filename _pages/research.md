My scientific interests are generally within the field of galaxy formation and
evolution and in particular their chemical enrichment through cosmic time. For
this I mainly work on observations across the electromagnetic spectrum of
energetic, transient phenomena such as fast radio bursts ([FRBs](frbs.md)),
gamma-ray bursts ([GRBs](grbs.md)), electromagnetic counterparts to
gravitational wave sources ([kilonovae](kilonovae.md)), and
[quasars](quasars.md).
These cosmic light houses are powerful probes of the interstellar and
intergalactic gas in and beyond galaxies in the line of sight, where I have
been particularly interested in damped Lyman-\alpha absorbers
([DLAs](dlas.md)).
