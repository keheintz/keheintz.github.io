# About Me

Hello there, my name is Kasper and I am currently a Postdoctoral researcher at
the University of Iceland. I am mainly working on gamma-ray bursts and quasars
and how they can be used as cosmic tools to study the dust, gas and metals in
intervening or host galaxy absorption systems. I am also part of a team that
searches for the electromagnetic counterparts of gravitational wave events,
such as merging neutron stars and/or black holes.

Here on my homepage you will find a brief description of the [research](research.md) projects
I am involved in, my [CV](/files/CV.pdf), and a list of my [publications](publications.md).
