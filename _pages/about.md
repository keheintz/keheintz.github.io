Hello there, my name is Kasper and I am currently a Postdoctoral researcher at the University of Iceland. I am mainly working on gamma-ray bursts and quasars and how they can be used as cosmic tools to study the dust, gas and metals in intervening or host galaxy absorption systems. I am also part of a team that searches for the electromagnetic counterparts of gravitational wave events, such as merging neutron stars and/or black holes.

Here on my homepage you will find a brief description of the research projects I am involved in, my CV, and a list of my publications.
