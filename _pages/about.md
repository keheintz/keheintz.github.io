# About Me

Hello there, my name is Kasper and I am currently a Postdoctoral researcher at
the University of Iceland. 
I am mainly working on observations of transient objects such as fast radio
bursts, gamma-ray bursts, kilonovae and quasars and in particular how these can
be used as tools to study the evolution of galaxies through cosmic time.

Here on my homepage you will find a brief description of the [research](research.md) projects
I am involved in, my [CV](/files/CV.pdf), and a list of my [publications](publications.md).
